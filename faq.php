        <h1 style="color: #f4ba3d !important;">SELECTION OF THE PARTICIPANTS</h1>

        <div id="accordion-1">
          <h3 style="cursor:pointer; color:#222A68; outline: none;">• When will I receive an answer to my application submission?</h3>
            <div>
              <p>We will process on a rolling basis. The organising team will respond to your application within 10 days. In the answer email, you will be informed about your status, which might be either "accepted" or "waiting list".</p>
            </div>

          <h3 style="cursor:pointer; color:#222A68;">• Why was I placed on the waiting list?</h3>
            <div>
              <p>Unfortunately, we only have 150 spots and therefore need to be selective in order to be representative of the variety of European youth organisations. Because of that, we need to wait for other, so far underrepresented applicants. Despite this, you might still be accepted later (see below).</p>
            </div>

          <h3 style="cursor:pointer; color:#222A68;">• When will the EYC stop accepting applications and make its final decisions?</h3>
            <div>
              <p>We will process on a rolling basis. The selection will end on February 12th at the latest. If by then there will be still free spots available, these will be filled with those on the waiting list (in order of application).</p>
            </div>

          <h3 style="cursor:pointer; color:#222A68;">• How will be the participants be selected?</h3>
            <div>
              <p>The selection is based on a formula ensuring representativeness. We take into account the type of your organisation, your position, whether you are available for all days, your gender and your country of origin.</p>
            </div>

          <h3 style="cursor:pointer; color:#222A68;">• I don’t have a specific position in my organisation. Can I still apply?</h3>
            <div>
              <p>Of course. We are looking for as much diversity as possible.</p>
            </div>

          <h3 style="cursor:pointer; color:#222A68;">• I’m not part of any organisation. Can I still apply?</h3>
            <div>
              <p>Yes! We also value your motivation, among others.</p>
            </div>

          <h3 style="cursor:pointer; color:#222A68;">• I’m not a citizen of the European Union. Can I still apply?</h3>
            <div>
              <p>Please do. Some places are reserved for non-EU member state applicants because we believe they can enhance the debate with their own experiences.</p>
            </div>

          <h3 style="cursor:pointer; color:#222A68;">• Can I arrive later than Thursday middays?</h3>
            <div>
              <p>In most cases not. Our special method requires everyone to participate right from the start on Thursday.</p>
