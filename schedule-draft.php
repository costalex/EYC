            <h1><strong>The European Youth Convention's Approach to create <br>the European Citizen's Constitution</strong></h1>
            <br><br>
            <p>Increasingly, in a society of complexity it will not be individuals and their heroic acts that count,
              but the ability of large numbers of informed people to interlink their knowledge to create better solutions.
              <br><br>
              Institutional and not individual leadership will matter most;
              many institutions are already today too large and too complex to be grasped by a single person alone.
              <br><br>
              The same holds true for the creation of a European Citizen's Constitution. How then, can we integrate the diverse expectations, visions and experiences of the 150 EYC-Members?
              How to leverage intelligence, emotions, values and energy tied up in individual players?
              <br><br>
            </p>

            <p><strong>Maximum use of our intelligence</strong>
              <br><br>
              We will create new ideas by joining what was separate, and we will generate these new ideas faster by simultaneously doing what otherwise would be done sequentially.
              The laws of interconnectedness and simultaneity are among the most powerful design resources for a better Europe.
            </p>

            <p>The social technology to achieve that is Malik Syntegration®. It is a high-performance communication approach for managing complexity,
              interconnectedness and rapid change. Large numbers of people find new solutions for complex questions by communicating simultaneously and in an interconnected manner,
              in such a way that their joint knowledge, experience, and their social energy lead to new solutions.
              <br><br>

              <strong>Great changes open up great opportunities – Europe’s great transformation</strong>
              <br><br>
              The Better Europe and the transition to it are complex but not “composed end to end.” There is no written score.
              The concept is open-ended and improvises along the way – but not in an unstructured manner. To use a different analogy:
              If you imagine the Better Europe as a painting, it will not show a detailed landscape but rather rules for the creation of landscapes, as well as instructions for defining new rules.
              <br><br>
              „Be ahead of change“ is one of the basic laws of successful transformation and this is the most effective strategy:
              initiate change yourself or others will do it – and be faster than others through innovative methods.
