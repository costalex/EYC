            <p><strong>Strasbourg, Day 1 of European Youth Convention</strong>
              <br>
              Today, 150 young Europeans from 38 countries have gathered at the European Parliament to start a mega project: writing a constitution for a better Europe in only four days.
              <br><br>
              The delegates of the European Youth Convention embody the future of Europe, the voice of a generation that grew up in a free and prosperous world where borders on (most of ) the continent no longer exist.
              <br><br>
              A fact underlined during the opening ceremony speech: “Europe as a whole is in miserable shape”, said Céline Geissmann, Vice-President of JEF France and co-organiser of the European Youth Convention (EYC). For the past ten years, economic turmoil, rising populism and Euroscepticism have tarnished the continent. “Europe is at crossroads, it needs more than ever to incorporate its youth in decision making”, commented Carina Autengruber, Vice-president of the European Youth Forum, in her opening words.
              <br><br>
              Too often have we heard politicians talk in the name of our generation, but not at all understanding our needs and vision for the future of the Union.
              <br><br>
              Next to the many #PulseOfEurope demonstrations throughout the continent in support of the EU, the European Youth Convention offers the perfect symbol to convey our message for a Union closer to its citizens, easier to understand and an overall a more united.
              <br><br>
              As we innovate for Europe, we also innovate in our way of debating. The Malik Management Institute is powering the EYC with its Syntegration® technology, managing 12 topics, which are focusing on various principles of the better Europe, as well as, core values of our continent.
              <br><br>
              As you are reading this article, our facilitators and script-writers are summing up the diagnosis of the first day. Stay tuned as the drafting of the constitution unfolds.
